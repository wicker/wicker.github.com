## Writing

<p class="centered">Mostly poetry and creative nonfiction.</p>

<a href="https://fishtrap.org/for-wallowa-county/fishtrap-fireside/">Fishtrap</a> says,

<blockquote>Jenner Hanni is a computer engineer and Marine veteran who thought he wanted to write creative nonfiction until someone at Summer Fishtrap’s Outpost told him about prose poems. 
<br /><br />
He moved to Wallowa County this past Labor Day to try and recover his health and sanity after seven years in Portland’s tech scene. 
<br /><br />
When not working or writing, he’s looking for foxes at the Iwetemlaykin State Heritage Site, imagining what it’s like to be the mountains, and catching up on years of missed reading.</blockquote>
