I'm a hardware developer who focuses on building networks of sensors to collect environmental data, whether indoors, in a city, or in a river or forest. 

#### Wickerbox Electronics

I develop both open and closed source hardware as a freelancer through <a href="http://wickerbox.net/">Wickerbox Electronics</a>, my company, but I prefer to develop in the open whenever I can. 

<!--I wrote a series of articles called <a href="#">Setting up a KiCad Workflow</a> about using KiCad, a free and open source schematic capture tool. My libraries, tools, Pandoc and LaTeX templates, and all my KiCad-related scripts are public.-->

I talked at OpenSourceBridge about <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1365">Math vs Mathematics</a> and <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1618">Design from Breadboard to PCB</a> in 2014, and about <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1618">Getting Started with KiCad</a> in 2015.

#### Hardware 

My Master's is in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on hardware, so that's what makes up most of my projects. My early designs were in Eagle but now I work exclusively in KiCad. I develop both standalone boards and attachable boards that fit platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Teensy. 

Here's some of what I do: 

- reverse engineer existing boards with no documentation
- work with the client to figure out requirements 
- order boxes or cases and design the boards to fit
- research, research, research, and then select components
- design circuits and create circuit schematics
- make the board layout by drawing the traces and placing parts 
- order and maintain inventory of boards, stencils, and parts
- assemble boards by hand soldering, reflow oven, and hot air station
- test and troubleshoot the boards

I'm <a href="http://www.wickerbox.net">available for hire</a> so most of my work is closed source and proprietary, but here's some of my open source work:
