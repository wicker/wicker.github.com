I'm a computer engineer, writer, and recent transplant to Wallowa County, Oregon. 

<strong>I'm currently looking for a software engineering job with a small company. </strong>

You can <a href="mailto:jenner@jennerhanni.net">email me</a>, check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenner-hanni" target="_blank">resume on LinkedIn</a>, and see my code at <a href="https://github.com/wicker/" target="_blank">Github</a>. 

I have customer support experience and I understand the importance of getting to and iterating on an MVP as soon as possible. I've developed hardware for a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/browndoggadgets/crazy-circuits-unique-stem-projects-delivered-mont" target="_blank">successful Kickstarter campaign</a> and continued to help bring that product to market. 

I've written C and VHDL/Verilog for FAA-certified <a href="https://www.astronics.com/about/subsidiary?subsidiaryItem=astronics%20max-viz" target="_blank">aircraft cameras</a>; lately I've been writing Python, Bash, Javascript, and HTML/CSS for <a href="/portfolio">web applications</a>. 

I have sysadmin experience and currently host sites with Apache/gunicorn on AWS and Linode. I've built public-facing sites using Flask, React, Jekyll, and Wordpress.

I own a hardware prototyping business called <a href="http://wickerbox.net" target="_blank">Wickerbox Electronics</a> and I've developed software called KiFisher to automate managing and documenting hardware projects with KiCad.
